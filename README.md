 # Blue Barracuda's Clue-less Project
This game is a simplified version of the popular board game, Clue. The main simplification is in the navigation of the game board. In Clue-Less there are the same nine rooms, six weapons, and six people as in the board game. The rules are pretty much the same except for moving from room to room.

## Prerequisites
There are only two dependencies required to run the game:
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/)
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)

## Usage
One player must be running the "server" that allows each of the players to connect as clients. After the server is running all players then will simply use Python3 to launch the gameapp.py file.

## Tests
Comprehensive unit and integration testing modules have been included. Tests can be run individually, or by utilizing Pytest on the Clue-less/tests/ directory.

## Development
Extensive source control processes were implemented for this project. In order to contribute, development must be directly related to an Issue which has been confirmed by two or more developers as required work.

Once an issue is confirmed it can be moved from the Backlog to be In Progress. At that point, a git branch must be created specific to the work being done on that issue.

Once development has been completed in a branch, a peer review is required. Peer reviews have been extremely beneficial to the project, directly leading to quality assurance work and the satisfaction of the project's requirements. Once development has been peer reviewed and all issues have been reconciled, it is moved to the Reviewed stage. The git branch for the development is then merged into the integ branch and staged to be merged into the master branch.
